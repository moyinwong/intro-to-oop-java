    /*
     * In the provided code, the value of num is assigned as 912345678, which is an
     * int data type. Then, the value of num is explicitly casted to a byte data
     * type using (byte) num.
     * 
     * In Java, a byte data type can hold values from -128 to 127. When a value is
     * casted from a larger data type (like int) to a smaller data type (like byte),
     * there is a possibility of data loss if the value exceeds the range of the
     * smaller data type.
     * 
     * In this case, the value 912345678 is outside the range of a byte, so when it
     * is casted to a byte, the result is truncated to fit within the range. The
     * least significant 8 bits of the int value are retained, resulting in the
     * value 78.
     * 
     * Therefore, when System.out.println(num2) is executed, it prints 78 to the
     * console.

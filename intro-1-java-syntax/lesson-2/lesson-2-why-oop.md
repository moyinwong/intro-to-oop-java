# Lesson 2. Why OOP?

It's a way of building and maintaining software programs by modeling **concepts**, **entities** and **processes** into **Classes (blueprint)**.

Programmer defines their **attributes & actions** and how they would **interact** with each other.

The real world is full of objects that interact with each other.

For example, different components of cars:

- Clutch
- Break
- Gas peddle
- Steering Wheel
- Gear box
- Control panel

Often time when building a program it involves a lot of reference and discussion to the objects in the particular **domain** the program is built for. By using OOP, it helps software engineers to effectively build and maintain programs.

The codes are easier to be understood and maintained as they are modeled in a way closer to the domain problem/concepts its solving.

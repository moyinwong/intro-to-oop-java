# Lesson 1. Intro to Java

## Difference between complied vs interpreted language

| Complied                                                                                                     | Interpreted                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source codes need to be complied to low level machine codes for the processor to execute and run the program | Source codes are interpreted line by line on the fly by the interpretor while the program is running |
| Pros: <br /> 1. run faster <br />2. complied once only <br/>                                                 | Pros: <br/>1. platform independence <br />2. good for scripting, easy to run                         |
| Cons: <br /> 1. platform dependent. Different compliers to complie machine codes for different processors    | Cons: <br /> 1. slower                                                                               |

## JDK, JRE, JVM

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

- include java complier to complie source codes into bytecode
- include JRE & JVM

### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

- include helpful class libraries, e.g. util, math
- include JVM

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

- interpret and execute bytecode
